# B8IS120-CA

Introduction to CA.
My CA will be on the Distributed systems of An Airport Booking. 
The Purpose of this is to Show how an Airport booking uses distributed systems in their Web services.
This project will be a forms on visual studio that will allow the viewing of flights from both Aer Lingus and RyanAir, while thee flights themselves will be stored in separate databases.
This will also have a payment section. if the VISA data is successfully stored in the database then it will keep the data for the flight booking. otherwise it will remove the booking.

There are a few objectives that I will be required to accomplish during this CA.
 I Will be Required to be able to connect/access each database and web services from the Main form project.
