# B8IS120-CA

Introduction to CA.
My CA will be on the Distributed systems of restaurant Bookings. 
The Purpose of this is to Show why Someone would want this kind of system as opposed to a physical booking system.
This project will be a forms on visual studio that connects to microsoft Azure that will allow the option to make a booking either from the base form that includes every restaurant abailable, or a new form for a specified restaurant
Prioritzing direct booking over open table booking?
open booking (general websites)/ Direct booking (calling the restaurant) etc.

There are a few objectives that I will be required to accomplish during this CA
 I Will be Required to be able to connect/access each restaurants booking database and to a general booking database
 I will also be required to prevent from double booking on a specified date/time in the same restaurant (two people concurrently trying to book the same place at the same time)
