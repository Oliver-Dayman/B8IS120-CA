For This Assignment I decided to Create A Distributed system on the flights booking of Ryanair and Aer Lingus. I decided to Do an Airport Booking form because having
a distributed system will allow users to seamlessly book flights with multiple airlines and pay using their preferred payment method. This creates a more conveniant
booking process for users.
This will also increase efficiency and decrease errors that are usually caused by a manual booking process. which can lead to reduced costs, faster booking times and a more reliable service.
