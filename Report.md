For This Assignment I decided to Create A Distributed system on the flights booking of Ryanair and Aer Lingus. I decided to Do an Airport Booking form because having
a distributed system will allow users to seamlessly book flights with multiple airlines and pay using their preferred payment method. This creates a more conveniant
booking process for users.
This will also increase efficiency and decrease errors that are usually caused by a manual booking process. which can lead to reduced costs, faster booking times and a more reliable service.

The requirements for This Distributed system to be developed is to include concepts such as concurrency, Fault tolerance, Process Scheduling, Scalability, transparency, and Latency.

The ones that will be included in this Distributed system are Concurrency, Fault Tolerance, and Latency.
I decided to design the distributed system by using 3 Databases in sql server management studio, and 4 visual studio projects. 
The databases were Air Lingus flights, RyanAir flights, and the VISA payment databases. While the projects were 1 windows form app, and 3 asp.net core web API.

The windows form app was the Main project. It includes all the visual components that are used.
The 3 asp.net web APIs are used for a database each. 

My analysis of this distributed system is
